The physics program of the CMS experiment during the CERN LHC Run 3 (2022--2026) expands the scope of long-lived particle searches by adding dedicated and improving existing triggers. These customized triggers and their performance are described in this paper, using several theoretical benchmark models that extend the standard model of particle physics. The results are based on proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector during 2022--2024 at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 123 ${\mathrm{fb}}^{-1}$.
